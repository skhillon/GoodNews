Finds the happiest headlines of the day.

## Getting Started
- [Follow this tutorial to learn how to set up iPython/Jupyter Notebooks](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46)
- Bonus: This article is written in Markdown, and Jupyter Notebooks also use Markdown. Skim through this or bookmark it: [Github Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- Bonus: Jupyter Notebooks also support LaTEX ("la-tech") for math equations. I doubt you'll need it, but keep this [LaTEX Cheat Sheet](https://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/latex/latexcheatsheet.pdf) handy.
